# Ground state estimation for Triton Toy model using VQE and QPE.

Project to find estimates for the ground state of the Triton Toy Model as defined by Roggero et al. 2019 (arXiv:1911.06368) using Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Quantum Phase Estimation methods. Quantum Circuit simulation performed using the CIRQ package.

The VQE is optimized using either a Nelder-Mead search or a naive grid search.

## To do:

Finish the Linear response section.
